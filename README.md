## Rust Tutorial

## Now I am learning Rust.

## I am following https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

**Day 1**

Here's what I've accomplished on Day 1:

1️⃣ Installed the Stable Version of Rust

2️⃣ Wrote a Simple "Hello World" Code

3️⃣ Understood the basics of Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system

**Day 2**

Here's a glimpse of what I accomplished Day 2:

1️⃣ A hands-on way to introduce you to many new Rust concepts: let, match, functions, the use of external crates, and more. I am practicing the fundamentals.

2️⃣ Implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. 

**Details about the game:** the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.

**Day 3**

Today was all about diving deep into variables, understanding mutability, and exploring various data types including integers, floats, booleans, and characters.

Today I learned:

1️⃣ Mastering Variables & Mutability: I delved into the concept of variables in Rust, exploring how to declare them, assign values, and manipulate data effectively.

2️⃣ Exploring Data Types: Rust offers a rich set of data types like Integers, Floats, Booleans, and Characters.
