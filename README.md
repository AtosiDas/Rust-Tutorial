## Rust Tutorial

## Now I am learning Rust.

## I am following https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

**Day 1**

Here's what I've accomplished on Day 1:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Installed the Stable Version of Rust

2Ô∏è‚É£ Wrote a Simple "Hello World" Code

3Ô∏è‚É£ Understood the basics of Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system

**Day 2**

Here's a glimpse of what I accomplished Day 2:

1Ô∏è‚É£ A hands-on way to introduce you to many new Rust concepts: let, match, functions, the use of external crates, and more. I am practicing the fundamentals.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. 

**Details about the game:** the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.

**Day 3**

Today was all about diving deep into variables, understanding mutability, and exploring various data types including integers, floats, booleans, and characters.

Today I learned:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Mastering Variables & Mutability: I delved into the concept of variables in Rust, exploring how to declare them, assign values, and manipulate data effectively.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploring Data Types: Rust offers a rich set of data types like Integers, Floats, Booleans, and Characters. 

**Day 4**

Here's a rundown of what I covered:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Unlocking Compound Types: I dedicated time to understanding these compound types, exploring their syntax.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Mastering Functions: Also I know about the functions, gain insights into parameter passing, return values.

**Day 5**

Today marks a significant milestone in my coding journey! 

1Ô∏è‚É£ Explore Control Flow: Learn about if - else statement, and various types of loops.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Solve exercies: There are 3 problems in the last of chapter 3. Try to solve these.

**Day 6**

Today marks a significant milestone in my coding journey! üéâ

Here's what I accomplished:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Explored Ownership: Learned about the Ownership variables, variable scope, String type, and memory and allocation. üíª‚ú®

**Day 7**

Today marks a significant milestone in my coding journey! üéâ

1Ô∏è‚É£ Today, I delved into Rust's ownership, borrowing, and slices, key concepts ensuring memory safety. Rust grants control over memory usage, automating cleanup via ownership, and eliminating manual memory management hassles.

**Day 8**

Today, I delved into the concept of structs in Rust.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Structs Exploration: Explored the fundamentals of structs in Rust, learning how they organize related data fields.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Practical Application: Implemented my understanding by defining a struct representing a rectangle and creating a method to calculate its area based on width and height.
