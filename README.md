## Rust Tutorial

## Now I am learning Rust.

## I am following https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

**Day 1**

Here's what I've accomplished on Day 1:

1️⃣ Installed the Stable Version of Rust

2️⃣ Wrote a Simple "Hello World" Code

3️⃣ Understood the basics of Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system

**Day 2**

Here's a glimpse of what I accomplished Day 2:

1️⃣A hands-on way to introduce you to many new Rust concepts: let, match, functions, the use of external crates, and more. I am practicing the fundamentals.

2️⃣ Implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. 

**Details about the game:** the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.
